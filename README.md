In C++, make_unique is a utility function introduced in C++11 to create and return a std::unique_ptr with a dynamically allocated object. It is specifically designed for managing ownership of dynamically allocated memory, providing a safer alternative to raw pointers by ensuring automatic cleanup when the unique_ptr goes out of scope.

## Syntax and Usage:
To use make_unique, you need to include the <memory> header file, which provides the necessary utilities for smart pointers.

```cpp
#include <memory>

// Example of creating a std::unique_ptr using make_unique
std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(42);

```
## Features and Benefits:
- Automatic Memory Management: make_unique allocates memory for the object passed as its argument and returns a unique_ptr that manages the allocated memory. This helps prevent memory leaks and ensures proper cleanup when the pointer goes out of scope.

- Type Safety: make_unique infers the type of the allocated object from the argument passed, making it type-safe and reducing the likelihood of errors related to pointer arithmetic or memory access.

- No Need for new and delete: Unlike raw pointers, you do not need to explicitly call new or delete. The unique_ptr manages memory allocation and deallocation automatically.

#### Example:
Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of make_unique:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

int main() {
    // Creating a std::unique_ptr to an int using make_unique
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(10);

    // Accessing the pointed-to object
    std::cout << "Value pointed to by ptr: " << *ptr << std::endl;

    // Modifying the value through the pointer
    *ptr = 20;
    std::cout << "Modified value: " << *ptr << std::endl;

    // No need to explicitly delete the memory, handled by unique_ptr

    return 0;
}
```

### Additional Notes:
- **Array Allocation**: make_unique can also be used to allocate arrays, unlike make_shared. For example, std::make_unique<int[]>(10) would allocate an array of 10 ints.

- **Custom Deleters**: If needed, you can pass a custom deleter function or lambda to make_unique to specify how the allocated memory should be cleaned up.

- **Avoiding Memory Leaks**: By using make_unique, you reduce the risk of memory leaks compared to manually managing memory with raw pointers.

### Compatibility:
make_unique is available in C++11 and later versions of the C++ standard. It's considered the preferred way to manage dynamically allocated memory using unique_ptr, providing a safer and more efficient alternative to raw pointers.

# Shared Pointer

In C++, **shared_ptr** is a smart pointer that manages the ownership of a dynamically allocated object. It is part of the C++ Standard Library and provides shared ownership semantics, meaning multiple shared_ptr instances can point to the same object. The object is automatically destroyed when the last shared_ptr pointing to it is destroyed or reset.

## Features and Benefits:
- Automatic Memory Management: shared_ptr automatically manages the lifetime of the object it points to. When the last shared_ptr pointing to an object is destroyed or reset, the object itself is automatically destroyed, preventing memory leaks.

- Shared Ownership: Multiple shared_ptr instances can share ownership of the same object. Each *shared_ptr* keeps a reference count internally, ensuring the object is not destroyed until all shared pointers to it are destroyed or reset.

- Null Pointer Safety: shared_ptr supports null pointers and provides safe null handling, ensuring no undefined behavior when working with uninitialized or released resources.

- Custom Deleters: You can specify custom deleter functions or lambdas when constructing a shared_ptr, allowing customized cleanup actions when the object is no longer needed.

Usage Example:

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() { std::cout << "MyClass Constructor" << std::endl; }
    ~MyClass() { std::cout << "MyClass Destructor" << std::endl; }
    void doSomething() { std::cout << "Doing something..." << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    // Creating a shared_ptr to MyClass
    std::shared_ptr<MyClass> ptr1 = std::make_shared<MyClass>();

    // Creating another shared_ptr pointing to the same object
    std::shared_ptr<MyClass> ptr2 = ptr1;

    // Using the shared_ptrs
    ptr1->doSomething();
    ptr2->doSomething();

    // The object is automatically destroyed when all shared_ptrs are out of scope
    return 0;
}
```
##Explanation of the Example:
- std::make_shared: Used to create a shared_ptr instance pointing to a newly created MyClass object. It is preferred over new due to improved efficiency and exception safety.

- Shared Ownership: ptr1 and ptr2 both share ownership of the same MyClass object. The object is destroyed only after both ptr1 and ptr2 are destroyed.

- Automatic Cleanup: The destructor of MyClass is automatically called when the last shared_ptr (ptr1 and ptr2) is destroyed, ensuring proper cleanup of resources.

## Additional Considerations:
- Circular References: Be cautious of circular references among shared_ptr instances, as they can lead to memory leaks. In such cases, consider using weak_ptr to break the cycle.

- Thread Safety: shared_ptr is thread-safe for operations on different objects but requires external synchronization when accessing or modifying the same object from multiple threads.

- Performance: While shared_ptr provides powerful memory management capabilities, it incurs overhead due to reference counting. For performance-critical scenarios, consider using unique_ptr or raw pointers where appropriate.

## Conclusion:
shared_ptr in C++ is a powerful tool for managing dynamic memory allocation and ownership with shared semantics. It enhances code safety, reduces the risk of memory leaks, and simplifies memory management in complex applications. Understanding its usage and benefits is essential for writing modern and robust C++ code.
